# Notes Friday 11 April
## Stuff related to Delphi

-	interpolation doesn't take into account the noise. We want the generation of a model that will output "virtual" measurements
-	Maybe add phase to the voltage function
-	Two kinds of queries
	-	Give me the actual model
	-	I don't care about the model I just care about the actual generated data.	



### Possible solutions
-	propabilistic databases
