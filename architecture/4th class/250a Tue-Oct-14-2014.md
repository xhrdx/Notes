# Metrics

We need to be able to say that one architecture is better than another.
Bandwidth makes sense if it is defined within a certain ammount of time.

Latency is time: how much we have to wait for a certain operation
Bandwidth is how many things we can do/transfer 

Energy is how much computation costs (Having money)

Power is how much we burn per unit time (acting like we have money, rate at which we spend them)

## speedup > 1 is good

speedup = (before time)/(after time)

## Benchmark 

Hardware provide compilers that are hardware specific (Oh wait is this algorithm equal to this one, Oh let me reorder these instructions and get a speedup of 4x) <- hack

## How to summarize performance

Geometric mean is the most balanced one
