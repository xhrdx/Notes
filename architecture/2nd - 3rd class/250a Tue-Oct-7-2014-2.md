## Resistance slide

###Supercoductor: 0 resistance but you have to keep it really cool (low temperature)
so the cost of cooling this thing makes it inneficient

### Silicon Nanowire / nano tube:
No heat loss (electrons just zip through... They don't bounce on atoms etc) It's hard to get electrons into the wire but once they're in there the transfer is resistance free...

## CMOS logic: Delay slide

equation: fixed delay, slope fixed number

## Driving Large Loads

Clock is a huge powerdrain-> lot of gates -> lot of capacitors for every flop-flop


More gates -> more inverters to buffer/amplify the signal

If we plan on adding a connection that goes off chip then we need to amplify it by a lot! Cuz the external devices that are gonna be connected require more power...

## Wire properties

PC board is where the chip is integraded to...

The resistance of the PCB is really low

If we want to send a signal far away faster use a bigger cable -> less resistance... 

for lots of transistors use smaller cables,for a few transistors use bigger cables less resistance,faster...

## Optimizing CMOS Power slide

For transistors 3 voltages are important:

Ground and overdrive (vdd) if vdd is smaller then less energy is required.

BUT Vt (threshold voltage) also counts cuz if vdd is way close to gnd but vt is above vdd then our transistor is always off...

LET'S move Vt close to ground! Nope, there is a problem, the closer the vt is to gnd the leakier the transistor is... So it never turns off...

We need to be careful with Vt cuz if it's too low the transistor might just be sitting there and burning energy...

And we need to have a fairly low Vdd cuz switching from 0 to 1 also costs...

Leaky transistors are "OK" if you're not using a lot of them and it might significantly speed up the CPU's performance if these transistors are the bottleneck.

## Silicon Memories - slide

F: smallest feature you can create -> $F^2$ are to such wires crossing

1 hot signal a lot of outputs and only one of them can be ON. Like the row decoder that specifies exactly one location.

Sense amps are listening for the signal that's gonna come down and amplify it... Column decoder takes the signal and generates the data...

All these wires are really long so there is a lot of energy getting burnt

## CMOS Logic: Driving Large Loads

Inverters used to amplify the signal. A lot of memory cells grouped together closesly and we have "Arnold" pick the signal up.

## The essense of Moore's Law

Tick: shrinking an old design
Tock: a completely new design


So intel can work on a new design every (let's say) 4 years but keep making new products (marketing trick)

Smaller design -> cheaper to manufacture (less material needed)

## What Determines the cycle time today? - slide

Critical path is the longest path between two gates... We can't force a clock time less than it takes to send the electrical signal between these two...

So let's put less gates/pipeline the chip more... 

(old days 10-16 levels of gates)

But now we are not limited by the gates... This is fast now. The problem is heat/power that are driving the frequency low

## More on Scaling - slide

We wanna know the properties of the individual transistor...

So... From Moore's law 

180-60 -> 180/60= 3 ratio.... but it's $s^2=3^2=9$ times as many transistors and S times faster (that is each transistor is 3 times faster)

But that takes more power $3*3^2=27$ times more power

So let's do a "hack" let's lower the Vdd. But we can't do that any more 2X shortage (if we shrink the chip and use power them fully that means that they are 2 times more inneficient)

So the idea is that you either use less cores to power the processor or you use more transistors but the frequency you use is less that what this thing can take...


## Power/Energy Conservation Tricks

* If you are unnecesarily using transistors you unnecesarily use more power
(example with multiplexer A +/-/* B (with a certain opcode) you only do a single operation but you'll consume power cuz you're using 2 more registers etc)

* Power Gating It takes time cuz if there's a saden force of power coming in in every block it will cuz noise to the near-by circuits


## Energy of communication v. computation

16 nano Joules to send something to DRAM it's cheaper to compute something (20-50 pico Joules) than store it...

Locality is important (sending something across long cables is inefficient power and time wise)


## Final thoughts of Moore's Law

IT'S A CONSPIRACY! When intel is building a new transistor they work with 100 other companies that manufacture the material and so on... So nobody can really be so far away from any other competitor
